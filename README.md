## Numercal methods
Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. 
Some of the numerical methods are Simpsons for numerical integeration, cubic splines, and fixed point iteration. 
I implemented these methods using python with the help of some packages like matplotlib, numpy, etc.
